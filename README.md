# Fan-Speed-Controller-using-Temperature---ATmega32

Hallo, all
This is a mini project of my Embedded software basic diploma at "EDGES for training"

A summery of the project: it is simply a fan that changes state or speed based on temprature (change happens every 30 degree).

o	Utilized: GPIO, ADC, PWM, LM35 Sensor, LCD, and DC Motor.

o	Microcontroller: ATmega32.

You can read the full requirments in the attached file.
Thank you.
